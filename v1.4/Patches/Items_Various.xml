			<description>A small potion containing a package of genetic information. To use a gene potion, a pawn can consume by ingesting the potion and will receive the contained genes, however, the gene potion will be used up in the process. Another way to use the gene potion is that it must be placed in a gene bank near a mutagen assembler and combined into an implantable xenogerm.\n\nIf not kept in a powered gene bank, this gene potion will slowly deteriorate and become inactive. Inactive gene potions can be revitalized in the mutagen assembler.</description>
